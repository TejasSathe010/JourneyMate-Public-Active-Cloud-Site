# JourneyMate - Travel Planner

JourneyMate is a one-stop travel planner designed to simplify the planning process for travelers. It integrates all your travel needs, from tracking expenses to building custom itineraries, so you can focus on making memories instead of logistics. Our mission is to make travel planning accessible and enjoyable for everyone—whether you’re exploring nearby destinations or traveling across continents.

## Who We Are

**Friends discussing over pizza**  
It’s said that all good ideas are born over pizza. JourneyMate was no exception, brought to life on one of our many pizza nights filled with discussions and dreams. The four of us, driven by both a love for travel and a passion for tech, envisioned a way to simplify the planning process for travelers everywhere. So, with slices in hand and ideas flowing, JourneyMate was born.

We know that travel is more than just reaching a destination; it's about creating experiences, finding peace of mind, and enjoying every moment of the journey. With JourneyMate, gone are the days of setting up endless reminders or scribbling plans in diaries. Our tool seamlessly integrates all your travel needs, so you can focus on what really matters—your adventure.
